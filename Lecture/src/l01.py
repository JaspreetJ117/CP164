# Public and Private

Notes:
Public and Private Attributes:
    - Public and Private methods are the 
    differeance between being the user and others
    - Python and java have different public and private 
    - Differenced based on how its name
    - No way to enforce private or public

# Classes
"""
Defining Classes
Two parts: 
    - The name of a class
    - The class constructor. the Constructor is always named
    __init__ (underscores play an important role in Python 
    variable in method naming, as we will see.

Every class will have a NAME and a defining method which is init

class NAME:
    def __init__(self , value):
        self.VALUE = VALUE
"""
# Objects
"""
Creating an object
To create an object we need to call an constuctor 
     object = NAME([VALUE])
Never call the dunderinit as python itself
